- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @poordigitalnomad
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in philosophy, literature, politics and music
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Linux and how NOT to break my rasperry pi again. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: if you want to delete files via terminal, make sure to remove the RIGHT files on the RIGHT path. I never sweatted so much on that day. 

I created this account here to track my coding progress. I will occassionally load up a few of my (basic) programs.
